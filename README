* 'svndiff' can be used much like 'svn diff', except it adds a new
  revision specifier 'BRANCHPT' (or 'BRPT') which refers to the revision
  just before the file was branched off (copied, more precisely).
  Use this for seeing all changes in the current branch so far for a given
  file.
* 'svndiff_helper' is intended for use with the --diff-cmd argument of
  'svn diff' (or indeed 'svndiff') and uses gvimdiff as the diffing tool.
  The feature it adds beyond the more trivial wrapper script everybody uses
  for this is that it names the buffer according to what svn tells it --
  so Vim displays it as "file.c (revision 44)" instead of "tmpfile.tmp".
  The easiest way of using it is by setting
    diff-cmd = svndiff_helper
  in section [helpers] in your ~/.subversion/config.
* 'svnclean' deletes all files not tracked by SVN - these are the ones
  marked with a '?' in the output of 'svn status'. It optionally also
  includes files ignored by SVN - the ones marked 'I' in the output of
  'svn status'. It lists files before deleting them, and prompts for
  confirmation, although both behaviours can be turned off with switches.
